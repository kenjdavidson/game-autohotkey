# Game Autohotkey Configurations

Just some AutoHotKey functionality for different games

## Dark and Darker

### Jump Crouch

- Remap `space` to jump crouch

### Purchase Pots and Bandages

- Auto purchase pots and bandages with `f12`
- Defaulted to white 3 \* 3
- `Ctrl-f12` to configure the purchase options
- TODO: would like to save the config to a file for future runs

### Quick Spell Selection

- Remap `1` through `5` to quick spell selection on the `e` key.
- This needs to be reworked a little or re-configured to maybe a rotation of spells, for example `1` will rotate between X spells.
